why and what you find interesting about your chosen project ?
why?
 1) I have intrest in robots , drones, robowars etc.
 2) Curious to know the functioning of robots ( Robotic Arm ) , actions of robots through programming.
 3) One of the reason why i wana take Robotic Arm as my summer project is human behavior , like we will make a machine that acts as human hand. 
 4) As you have written your time commintment as  18 hours/week , offcourse i will be happy to invest my time to nearn these intersting knowledge.
 5) Most importantly, TO WORK AS A TEAM , this is what the best part of any project , like 15- 20 people working on same projects, unique ideas,hangout, chilling together, maybe nightout as well:)

What?
 1) Firstly i like the presentation you have given on SNT project intro.
 1) I also like the model and idea , Robotic Arm, human hand functioning.
 2) In About section of this project, you had said that we will work on controls of motors (interesting part), we will also use microcontrollers,inverse kinematics. it means a chance to learn a lot.
 3) Same goes for learning values, a lot to learn .
 4) Time commintment : 18 hrs/week . Neither you did overload nor too less time commintment. its perfect. 
 5) One thing i found very interesting is you have added some General tasks in your summer project task , and that student search profile pic :)
